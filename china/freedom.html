    <title>China: Owned by its People</title>
    <meta name="description" content="China to judge each of its 1.3 billion people based on their social behavior. Security holes left in China-made phones by the direction of China government. Top management is connected to, reports to, or even being appointed by the Government of China. Their government controls the information dissemination, inflow and outflow. Does the China government do the things right? The costs are paid by the China people. Lack of freedom strangulates. They are winning by their numbers and strict, army-like order. Lack of freedom in China handicaps its development and growth.">

<h2>Beijing to Judge Every Resident Based on Behavior by End of 2020</h2>

</div>
<p>China’s plan to judge each of its 1.3 billion people based on their social behavior is moving a step closer to reality, with Beijing set to adopt a lifelong points program by 2021 that assigns personalized ratings for each resident.</p>
<p>The capital city will pool data from several departments to reward and punish some 22 million citizens based on their actions and reputations by the end of 2020, according to a plan posted on the Beijing municipal government’s website on Monday. Those with better so-called social credit will get “green channel” benefits while those who violate laws will find life more difficult.</p>
<p>The Beijing project will improve blacklist systems so that those deemed untrustworthy will be “unable to move even a single step,” according to the government’s plan. Xinhua reported on the proposal Tuesday, while the report posted on the municipal government’s website is dated July 18.</p>
<p>China has long experimented with systems that grade its citizens, rewarding good behavior with streamlined services while punishing bad actions with restrictions and penalties. Critics say such moves are fraught with risks and could lead to systems that reduce humans to little more than a report card.</p>
<h3>Ambitious Plan</h3>
<p>Beijing’s efforts represent the most ambitious yet among more than a dozen cities that are moving ahead with similar programs.</p>
<p>Hangzhou rolled out its personal credit system earlier this year, rewarding “pro-social behaviors” such as volunteer work and blood donations while punishing those who violate traffic laws and charge under-the-table fees. By the end of May, people with bad credit in China have been blocked from booking more than 11 million flights and 4 million high-speed train trips, according to the National Development and Reform Commission.</p>
<p>According to the Beijing government’s plan, different agencies will link databases to get a more detailed picture of every resident’s interactions across a swathe of services. The proposal calls for agencies including tourism bodies, business regulators and transit authorities to work together.</p>
<p>The tracking of individual behavior in China has become easier as economic life moves online, with apps such as Tencent’s WeChat and Ant Financial’s Alipay a central node for making payments, getting loans and organizing transport. Accounts are generally linked to mobile phone numbers, which in turn require government IDs.</p>
<p>The final version of China’s national social credit system remains uncertain. But as rules forcing social networks and internet providers to remove anonymity get increasingly enforced and facial recognition systems become more popular with policing bodies, authorities are likely to find everyone from internet dissenters to train-fare skippers easier to catch -- and punish -- than ever before.</p>

<h2>Score-the-Man vs Pay-the-Man</h2>
<p>China government decided to use God-like control and to score its citizens.</p>
<p>Beijing does not believe in the virtue of its people, partly because the government itself is corrupt; and that's why they judge the people according to themselves.</p>
<p>Whereas USA believes in the virtue of its people, and gives its citizens money and freedom coming with them.</p>
<p>I prefer Pay-the-Man system. You can't trust in a machine (or for that reason any system) managing Your life. The system is cold and cruel machine. It doesn't care who is in front.</p>
<p>Allowing a machine or a system to take care of your life is suicidal.</p>
<p>Trusting in a system is a suicide.</p>

<h2>security breaches in China phones and phone equipment. Who is at fault?</h2>
<p>Why leave the China phone in Chinese warehouse.</p>
<p>Security breaches are being left in the phones by the 'security' China foxes! No, not fox spirits. Foxes were appointed to build a hen-house. And of course they left a small door for themselves. A small door for millions of foxes per second. And millions of foxes will get out of new China phone and say 'Hi!' Foxes saying 'Hi' out of Your new Chinese phone! 你好谢谢 [nihao! xiexie!] Hi and thank you!</p>
<p>I'm a smart China fox, No, I'm a smartphone China fox!!! Phony China fox ;)</p>
<div property="description"><!--Change to review!!!-->
<p>The truth is: who has the power and owns the land wins in China.</p>
<p>China Government</p>
<p>Politeness and wordplay are the China government language.</p>
<h2>China Companies: Strangulated by Government</h2>
<p>Though only some firms in China owned directly by government, security personnel and the top management are severely controlled by the government of China.</p>
<p>China companies are often described by China government folks with a misleading phrase like "owned by its employees". The phrase indicates diffusion of responsibility, also cover-up of those who are really responsible; raises red flag. Nobody can lie 100%. It leaks.</p>
<p>Another popular phrase like “our company operates independently of Beijing” is wordplay and nonsense. "We operate independently of Beijing, but 90% (or less) of our employees, including the top management, are from Beijing. Guess who is who and doing what."  Guess who is from the government, and what do they do. A hint from a similar case is here: <a class="link" href="https://nakigoe.github.io/ru/grim.html" target="_blank">Exit Russia</a> More freedom than in this case? Doubtfully more free. Of course all top management in all major China firms is connected to, reports to, or even being appointed by the Government of China. How many of you have been in an autocratic country? Their government controls the information dissemination, inflow and outflow.</p>
<p>Does the China government do the things right? The costs are paid by the China people. Lack of freedom strangulates. Lack of freedom handicaps development and growth. The Empire strangulates its citizens by severe birth control, unimaginable air pollution, 'rate the man' vs 'pay the man' policy, brainwashing by fairy-tails instead of proper education and critical thinking implementation. Life is precious, and it must be protected. The wisdom from above is first and foremost, clean. Necessitous men are not free men. Brainwashed men are just obedient zombies. They are winning by their numbers and strict, army-like order.</p>
<h2>Economy Score</h2>
<p>Although Chinese GDP (gross domestic production) almost equals to than one's of the USA, distribution of GDP per capita (resources per person) is so low in so many ways. Chinese firms are desperate for air: resources, investment, and freedom. Due to the lack of 'air' many Chinese firms have to play dirty tricks to stay on the surface. The competition for investment and resources is extremely high in China.</p>
<p>Men still come out cheaper than guns under Beijing's regime.</p>
<p>"I'm from the government and I'm here to help you" phrase usually means possible beginning of a nightmare for a Chinese firm. Police doesn't help. It forbids and punishes. More often than not the current government policy is "praise your own son, and suspect your neighbour".</p>
<p>If you decide to invest in China, do be prepared to low return rates, group contempt, and being a bourgeois laissez-faire outsider in strong communal dynamics.</p>
<p>China is all about position, dignity, and status. 立场和身份 [lìchǎng hé shēnfen]. You have to be a god if you want to find Your place anb be accepted well in China.</p>
<p>Gods are free, gods can move freely and even liberate others; but social constraints can apply severely even to gods.</p>
<p>Officials survive when group dynamics goes south and conflict emerges.</p>
<p>Peasants die. Fast.</p>

<h3 property="potentialAction" typeOf="Action" resource="#action">What to Do?</h3>
<meta property="name" content="Study Chinese" about="#action">
<p property="description" about="#action">Study Chinese language. Pay attention to underwater culture, ignore the formal etiquette when people address you. Most often than not it is completely insencere. Be polite to the point of flattery and deception, return the favour ten-folds. Avoid getting close to unfamiliar people fast, you can be just used, grilled, steam-rolled, and eaten. Keep your face and honor. Promoting and high-ranking oneself is vital in China. Posturing, intimidation, showing off, beautiful moves, 'being cool' and keeping rank artificially high is top priority, it is even more important than addressing actual skill. Despite the common misconception and misinformation, boasting is a major asset, drive, and trait of Eastern culture. What you eat, what you wear, the place you live in, your connections, etc. is a part of this common boasting. Make others adress your skills as of top, highest rank, god-like in competition settings. Hell, even your equipment gets ranked!</p>
<p>Chinese people are extremely concerned with beautiful titles, even to the point of disregarding the actual meaning of the words in the title and the actual equipment / skill / person involved.</p>
<p>To Chinese getting a high score in any test and / or any ranking system is of more importance than the actual skill being tested. 
<br>That's why high IELTS score is of more importance to Chinese people than the pronunciation, grammar, and the actual English itself.</p>
<p>Confront herd thinking by paying special attention to actual skills and results. Pay attention to any healthy world-view.</p>
<p>There are benefits of being a generalist rather than a specialist, it is of teaching or training techniques that seem to fall flat but pay off in the long run.</p>
<p>Teachers who “teach to the test”, or otherwise provide simple problem-solving procedures, immediately improve grades and their students thank them for it. But in the long-term, the students suffer from not having been forced to think more deeply.</p>
<p>Keep most of Your training at low intensity, resist the temptation to train too hard.</p>
<p>Avoid magical thinking, any form of 'qi' absurd delusion, tai-chi, Chinese medicine, feng shui, astrology, and people heavily involved in mysticism like a plague, this is what they really are.
<br>This psychedelic stuff (where the actual psychedelics are more often involved than not) brings poverty, grim, and extreme torment to everybody involved. It's a pleasing intervention that does no good.</p>
<p>There is NO Jedi. Period. And if there is any form of bacteria in your blood, this means you are about to be ugly dead very much soon.</p>
<p>It's about you, your team, your skills, knowledge, equipment, and professionalism. About air and water purity, and food quality, the things you take into your body and your mind. It's NOT about 'luck' and 'being cool and showing beautiful moves' and 'having qi / bacteria / psychedelics' in your bloodstream. It's about counting, actual results, and critical thinking.</p>
<p>Good luck to you, China Phone, government doggies. Good luck to you, you gonna need it.</p>
<p>When life confronts You with an unplayable piano, perhaps You should sit down and try to play it. Master Chinese pronunciation and writing.</p>
<p>It's China time. Enter China!!! Now you are ready. ME, god, says so.</p>
