<h2>Insane, Hazardous, Evil, Ugly, Monstrous, Malicious, Miser, Irremediably&nbsp;Stupid Russia</h2>
<p>USSR has turned into the den of the dead. And the dead are hunting for the living.</p>
<p>Russia has been turning into the country of the dead for centuries.</p>
<p>Yeargh, Halloween whole year throughout. Every day.</p>
<h3>Bandits in Shoulder-Straps</h3>
<p>Russia and tyranny always crawl together.</p>
<p>Tsar system has never dissappeared completely in Russia.</p>
<p>Current Russian president, the head of Russia FSB, the main successor agency to the KGB, before assuming the presidency in 2000, was working for Russian KGB in Eastern Germany and Stasi.</p>

<p>Mr. President is rotten too much to stand him. Has he ever told a single truth in his whole life? The Constitution allows only the means which are ‘necessary’, not those which are merely ‘convenient’ for effecting the enumerated powers. The Constitution restrained them to the necessary means without which the grant of power would be nugatory. The Prezi-bandit raped its country constitution. The rotted Prezident eats the country citizens while alive. There is a murderous intent behind his smile, merciless; a despicabale crook, a crafty scoundrel, and a trickster.</p>
<p>The president's group, army, political parties, public officials and civil servants, Russian Orthodox Church with undercover agents, GRU mafiosy style of group preservance, FSB omnipotence, OMON quick reaction, followed by the police, the office of public prosecutor, and public courts are the filthiest and the most corrupt institutions.</p>
<p><a class="link" href="https://www.transparency.org/cpi2018" target="_blank">Global Corruption Index</a> places Russia with a corruption score of 72 / 100 on 138 / 180 place in the world in terms of cleanness, with a cleanness score of 28 / 100;
<br> way below the cleanness score of <a class="link" href="https://nakigoe.github.io/china/freedom.html" target="_blank">China</a></p>
<p>Officials control money and guns distribution in the country. The main sources of the external finance inflow into the country, i.e. energy and defence-related sectors are unprivatized. The government has absolute power over its armless, speechless and generally needy population.

<p>Russian Government are a pack of rotten zombies. Usually people can see their make-up faces only on the internet or a zombie-censored TV programmes.</p>
<p>Why do you think they are hiding behind the high walls and darkened glass?</p>
<p>Lenin gets up at nights and roams when not guarded. Everybody bitten by him becomes a zombie too. It’s a weapon of all communists.</p>
<p>Why do you think they guard Lenin so much?</p>
<p>Russia is the den of Evil.</p>
<p>Artillery fire over Chechnya village filled with civilians, testified by former officer of the artillery group, who left the army "after the general who commanded them to open fire, later on a TV, standing on the site of the war crime and holding an artillery bomb shell in his hands, was lying through his teeth that there are even no such bombs in Russia". Forced army participation in Russia is still a gruesome reality. Furthermore, contract soldiers get only $500 a month for risking their lives guarding the Crimea.</p>
<p>Russian bandits-at-power murder their ex-colleagues.</p>
<p>All of them are the same, after getting power using it with absurdity.</p>

<p>Times for kind Russian professional agents are over. Now from 'professional' left only the last half of the word.</p>
<p>If there is a person in front of you in a uniform with a gun exposed and not showing his ID, neither giving You his business card with his full name on it and his phone number; and at the same time demands something of You and asks questions: congrats, You see a bandit in shoulder-straps.</p>
<p>If a person in uniform and with a gun exposed shows his ID and hides it immediately: congrats, You see an educated bandit in shoulder-straps.</p>
<h4>Agents twist testimony statements to suit their needs</h4>
<p>Distorting the testimony, they either bring You to some kind of absurd humiliating punishment, or let somebody at fault go free, if You:</p>
<p> • by Your own credulity and naïveté
<br> • being pressed by evil bandit boss with stars on the shoulder-straps</p>

</div>
<p>put Your sign on a record of evidence for worse.</p>

<p>Due to the abundance of rules and regulations in the former USSR and its republics, the incentives to evade rules and regulations by means of bribes are extremely high. With the dissipation of the USSR the same people remained in the controlling positions, and the abundance of regulations in Russia still creates incentives to give bribes.</p>
<p>With the dissipation of the formal ‘republican’ organization, much of what USSR contained inside has changed for the worse.
People: one should remember that every sound thinker who was disagree with the tyranny of Russian policy during the 19th and 20th century was severely oppressed, no matter what kind of government structure there were at power. Russian intelligentsia people who didn’t run from the country were murdered by the government, and sent to Siberia camps. After opening of the country in 1989 many who knew what was really happening in the country fled, including those many from scientific community. In 1990s every sound-minded left the country.</p>
<p>As a consequence, Russia has severe problems with the quality of education, quality of science and lack of scientists engaged in industry.</p>
<p>Meaningless exams, meaningless universities. Their certificates are nothing in the European world.</p>
<p>Medical Institutions also suffer due to corruption and sever lack of financial inflow into equipment and connection to the modern global medical data. Most of the articles published in English remain untranslated. For example, modern knowledge about the major importance of vitamin A and vitamin D is absent in most Russian medical institutions. You need about 10-20 minutes per day of Sun's exposure to get the daily dose of the vitamin D. Most part of the year that's impossible due to the sever Russian winter. That's one of the reasons why many Russians suffer from obesity and low height. Herb, homeopathy and grandma therapy (like useless vitamin C heavy doses) is still popular even among many doctors.</p> 
<p>Dentists pool the teeth out instead of providing necessary operations, surgeons cut the legs off instead of curing them, ministry of health takes the peoples' property to make the ministry of health quarters.</p>
<p>Intake the vitamin D daily if you have low Sun exposure, especially if you have dark skin!</p>

<h3>Russia Plans</h3>
<p>Having so much problems at their own country, how dare the Russian government to meddle into others’ countries affairs?!</p>
<p>Crazy weapon dealers. They are prepping for war, huge war. The only scientists that are left are Evil, that’s why they keep pumping poisonous gas to compensate the lack of manpower and money for future war.</p>
<p>They have a vested interest into training the Russian military for the future operations. They create ground to invade Serbia and Kosovo, like they shouted on the Red Square in the summer of 2018:</p>
<p>“Serbia, Kosovo, and Crimea is Russia!!!
<br>Russia go ahead, Serbia go ahead,
<br>Orthodoxy, orthodoxy, orthodoxy!!!
<br>Entered seashore Russian war machine!!!"</p>
<p>According to some officials' talks in Moscow Sheremetyevo Airport, Bulgaria and Hungary plan to join them and actively support Russia.</p>
<p>Winter is coming and most of them will sit at home, and then they explode in spring, right after -20℃ temperatures are over. Distance is a killer in Russia due to the lack of good roads and severe winter.</p>

<h3>Russian Banks</h3>
<p>Russian banks hate their customers, and have a strong tendency to collapse.</p>
<p>Sberbank of Russia is severely divided into smaller departments.</p>
<p>What does this mean? Inconsistent banking policy for different departments. E.g. You can make a rubble card in one department, but they do not give a dollar card, or a euro card. That’s why You move to another city to make a dollar card, then even to another region of the country to make a Euro card. That’s funny, ridiculous and plain stupid.</p>
<p>Now, if You come to another Sberbank, they can’t see the information of Your cards unless You manually provide them with a bank account number for every of Your cards, reasons being Your cards are from another region.</p>
<p>All the changes to the accounts come to the central division of Sberbank within 2! days. Whereas You can see everything online in Your cabinet real-time. That is, there is a time lag of 48 hours. If all the population of the country suddenly decides to withdraw their meagre deposits, the central bank will know that only after 2 days!!!</p>
<p>At the same time Sberbank top management engages in acquiring land and expensive <a href="https://mriyaresort.com/" target="_blank" class="link">luxury hotels in Crimea</a> instead of upgrading their servers, IT equipment and bank salaries. All the entry-level jobs in Sberbank are un-paid for the first 2 weeks.</p>
<p>This is so disgusting.</p>

<h3>Hate</h3>
<p>Those with any power hate the general population, which behaves like animals. The atmosphere of fear and hate persists among the population in return.</p>
<p>Doctors hate patients, patients hate doctors; army officers hate guys called up for military service, they hate the army in return, where they have to spend a year for free.</p>
<p>Country of slaves, 15 minutes to have food, 'cause there is a huge line to the army canteen.</p>
<p>Civil courts are conducted 5 minutes long, 'cause there is a line of 10 people in the hall's corridor.</p>
<p>USSR was a multinational country and had problems with the inner-national hatred suppressed within. These problems were controlled by the presence of a strong government. In 1990s after the dissipation of USSR control, waves of national hatred onslaught with civil wars and conflicts in many republics of the former “union”. These hatred attitudes against ‘other’ nations are still present and give voice wherever they can.</p>
<p>'Die you all.' is a common attitude; the feeling of bitter anger and intense fear runs deep in the country.</p>
<p>The country of curse and grim.</p>
<p>Cold and cruel like the devil himself.</p>
<p>The only time when they smile is when they hurt someone, with schadenfreude, the feeling of pleasure, joy, self-satisfaction that comes from learning of or witnessing the troubles, failures, or humiliation of another.</p>
<p>When You are in peril they will ignore you or even drawn you to help you die faster.</p>
<p>They keep sowing seeds of war, creating pretext for conflict to be able to enjoy the fighting.</p>
<p>Everyone who has any relations with them is either an Evil crook, or a naiveté being fooled.</p>

<h3>Poverty</h3>
<p>Disgustingly loathsome indifference to the problem, to the point of insensitivity that comes from another problem of severe inequality.</p>
<p>Gini coefficient rose from 0.23 (1988) to 0.5 (1992). Gini coefficient of 0.5 means that the probability that your neighbour is twice richer than you is 50%.</p> 
<p>Some steal billions (200 billion dollars’ scandal scandal); others steal cheap copper wire at a factory, where they work like slaves, for meagre salary of $200/month.</p>
<p>Economy is filled with regulations and statists, with a high concentration of wealth in officials' hands. Energy and defence-related sectors are still unprivatized. Although money generally comes into Russian economy with the export of oil, natural gas, steel, aluminium and extensive machinery building,</p>
<p>Who buys Russian?</p>

<p>Mean GDP growth rate: from 1996, the year when the denomination of the currency occurred, mean yearly GDP growth rate is 1%.
<br>per capita GDP = 5,800$ in 1990,
<br>per capita GDP = 3,500$ in 1996,
<br>per capita GDP = 6,800$ in 2015,
<br>social security benefits = 1,200$ per year!!! in 1996,
<br>social security benefits = 200$ per month!!! in 2018.

<br>The Russian currency now is 0.07 of its 1996 value. I.e. rubble now is 14 times less needed than in 1996.
For the last 1.5 years rubble lost 50% of its value to compensate for the 50% drop in the oil prices. So in rubbles government still has the same revenues. To get the money quickly in times of crisis government de-values its currency. The central bank hasn’t supported the rouble since late 2014. It let the rouble float freely from Nov. 10 of that year and eliminated regular interventions after spending several dozen billions of dollars from its reserves.
Yet government officials continue to claim that ‘they won’t let rouble fall’. Send them to hell!!! They are vicious liars!
<br>Now with little access to world markets and low competitiveness Russian economic future is grim.</p>

<h3>Russian Inflation Fighting Methods</h3>
<p>They type money to pay the military expenses ($500 month for contract soldiers guarding the Crimea, not considering forced military participation), and keep cutting wages manually throughout the country to fight the induced inflation. People from Moscow come directly to the factories: “Your wage was $1000month, now it is $500, period.”</p>
<p>Nonetheless, inflation from 2014 to 2018 is 100%. I.e. 2018 Russian currency half of its value that of 2014.</p>

<h3>Greenback, Vodka, and Power</h3>
<p>Russia drives people crazy.</p>
<p>Vice: in spite of USSR media and recreation control, also high level of propaganda, due to the growing disappointment about the results of the ‘communism’ and later the 'false democracy', the level of virtue in the country is low. The dissipation of USSR brought about the awakening of vice to the completely unprepared generation.</p>
<p>Love greenback and strong alcohol:</p>
 
<p>litres of pure alcohol consumption per capita 15l</p>
<p>cigarettes consumption per smoker 8,900 </p>
<p>52% of men and 15% of women smoke</p>
<p>est. 2.5mln drug addicts + regular drug users</p>
<p>registered living HIV-infected people 1mln, 2017</p>

<h3><span class="phrase">Defamate the President</span> <span class="phrase">After His Retire</span></h3>
<p>Vodka for last greenback,
<br>Stupid yellow fans,
<br>Always have nothing,
<br>And got nothing to dig.
<br>Stupid getting high,
<br>Animals indeed.
<br>Ki-i-i-ll the -cow!
<br>Ea-a-at the -burgs!
<br>Bwa ha ha ha ha!!!</p>
<p>Chorus</p>
<p>Defamate the Prezi-Bandit,
<br>Never let him see the grave.
<br>Send him to the land of horror,
<br>Live forever on the Russian Earth.</p>
<p>Russian cuckoo bandits,
<br>bwa-ha-ha-ha-ha,
<br>We shall find your money,
<br>bwa-ha-ha-ha-ha,
<br>Drop a bomb on Moscow,
<br>bwa-ha-ha-ha-ha,
<br>Rob the Leningrad.</p>
<p>Poor Russian niggers,
<br>No money left,
<br>Only stupid rockets,
<br>and another theft.</p>
<!--<p>
<p>Poor whity niggers
<br>Pumping oil and gas,
<br>Selling land for money,
<br>Dumping gold for brass.
<br>

<p>Crazy crooks and liars,
<br>niggers, oligarchs,
<br>send them rot in prison,
<br>with their money passed.</p>

<p>Kill the Russian nigger,
<br>loaded oligarch,
<br>Send them rot in hell.
<br>Miser ranch of slaves.</p>

<p>Loony Russian zombies,
<br>herd inside a fence,
<br>go eat your neighbour,
<br>rotten to the earth.
</p>-->
<p>Animals in fetters,
<br>crawling in the dirt,
<br>murdering each other
<br>even in the court!</p>
<p>Puppets of the Kremlin,
<br>killing for a fun,
<br>freaking hungry brothers,
<br>rotting in the Sun.</p>

<h3>Ural</h3>
<p>Have you ever heard about Mayak factory and the radioactive dust?</p>
<p>Mayak was the place where the government was developing atomic industry. Check, maybe you are flying over it? Please don't.</p>
<p>The only people who worked there where prisoners, who dumped the radioactive remains into the nearby dry lake.</p>
<p>And the thing Russians won’t tell you is that the Ural oil is almost over, the wells give now only 10% of oil, everything else is water. That’s why Russians plan to get Iranian oil even to the point of making a pipeline. Russians do not buy Iranian oil, like they said, only barter in weapons; (and of course, the Iranian side will pay for the pipe by means of oil,) because there is no money in Russia. Russians want everything for free. </p>

<h3>Fear</h3>
<p>Russians are afraid of
	<br> 1. defamation
	<br> 2. police
	<br> 3. being taken by genitals in a fight</p>
<p>Defamation by peers is a nightmare to most Russians due to the strong group dynamics in the country, in-group and out-group policy in everyday life.</p>
<p>Police break-in into the house is another horror, due to the knowledge of numerous human rights violation by police officers happening in Russia.</p>	

<h3>How to Fight Russians</h3>
<p>Defamate. Defamate. Defamate.</p>
<p>Call the police immediately to create pressure on them. Keep Your own hands clean.</p>
<p>If You are being attacked by Russians and have to use your own hands, play dirty to shortcut the fighting. Be fast.</p>
<p>Being taken by genitals in a fight is usually an unsuspected attack for most Russians, which turns heads to tails in a fight.</p>
<p>Then blind them, strangulate them, maim them at their feet. If they cannot see, or breath, or run, the fight is over.</p>
<p>Bonus tips, or how to do it really well: hit them in the jaw to break their teeth. Take an iron stick and dash them to pieces like a potter's vessel.</p>
<p>Humiliate them, mom upon mom.</p>
<p>Leave them without food, shelter and money. The summer is short, and Russian winter is long and severe.</p>
<p>Use surprise noise attacks by day to mess up with their ability to concentrate. Use low frequency noise attacks by night to interfere with their sleep.</p>
<p>Leave them with throw-away low-end broken machinery. Make them pay for it.</p>
<p>Immerse in dirt and blood. Repeat.</p>

<h3>Bandits' Country Must Be Destroyed</h3>
<p>Russians are crazy. And especially when they are drunk with power.</p>
<p>Russia is an animal den with a huge wall around it, and the Russian Government Bandits mass homestead animals within the country-(side).</p>
<p>Will Evil listen if you tell it to stop?</p>
<p>Russia must be destroyed. Like the Pompeii was.</p>
<p>God have us throw up on Moscow.</p>
<p>How many nuclear bombs would it take to reduce Russia and the former USSR to pebbles?</p>

<p>‘IT’ is here. Hazardous Russia.</p>

<p>Smash down heads when I hammerfist, tear heads up when I uppercut.</p>
<p>With an iron rod crush their teeth like the potter’s vessel.</p>
<p>I’ll crush their feet; and blind them. When they can’t see, or breath, or walk the fight is over.</p>
<p>Because they are evil and stupid animals within a den I’ll feel only disgust.</p>
<p>When I got no gun and no knife, that doesn’t matter, I’ll crush them with superior attitude.</p>
<p>I’ll throw them and break their neck in the air, while they still fly to the ground.</p>
<p>Buy me some coffee, You Brits, ‘cause I want to fight Russians, being angry and in the mood.</p>
<p>If I can’t exit Russia, I will destroy this ugly zombie-bandit nation.</p>
<p>Somebody buy me a stupid ticket out of here and give me an asylum.</p>
