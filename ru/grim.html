<p>Russia have turned into the country of the dead. And the dead are hunting for the living.</p>
<p>Russia have been turning into the country of the dead for centuries.</p>

<h3>Bandits</h3>
<p>Russia and tyranny always crawl together.</p>
<p>Mr. President, president's group, Russian army, political parties, public officials and civil servants, GRU, FSB, OMON, followed by the police, the office of public prosecutor, and public courts are the most filthiest and corrupt institutions.</p>
<p>Due to the abundance of rules and regulations in the former USSR and its republics, the incentives to evade rules and regulations by means of bribes are extremely high. With the dissipation of the USSR the same people remained in the controlling positions, and the abundance of regulations in Russia still creates incentives to give bribes.</p>
<p>With the dissipation of the formal ‘republican’ organization, much of what USSR contained inside has changed for the worse.
People: one should remember that every sound thinker who was disagree with the tyranny of Russian policy during the 19th and 20th century was severely oppressed, no matter what kind of government structure there were at power. Russian intelligentsia people who didn’t run from the country were murdered by the government, and sent to Siberia camps. After opening of the country in 1989 many who knew what was really happening in the country fled, including those many from scientific community. In 1990s every sound-minded left the country.</p>
<p>As a consequence, Russia has severe problems with the quality of education, quality of science and lack of scientists engaged in industry.</p>
<p>Meaningless exams, meaningless universities. Their certificates are nothing in the European world.</p>
<p>Medical Institutions also suffer due to corruption and sever lack of financial inflow into equipment and connection to the modern global medical data. Most of the articles published in English remain untranslated. For example, modern knowledge about the major importance of vitamin A and vitamin D is absent in most Russian medical institutions. You need about 10-20 minutes per day of Sun's exposure to get the daily dose of the vitamin D. Most part of the year that's impossible due to the sever Russian winter. That's one of the reasons why many Russians suffer from obesity and low height. Herb, homeopathy and grandma therapy (like useless vitamin C heavy doses) is still popular even among many doctors.</p> 
<p>Intake the vitamin D daily if you have low Sun exposure, especially if you have dark skin!</p>

<h3>Hate</h3>
<p>USSR was a multinational country and had problems with the inner-national hatred suppressed within. These problems were controlled by the presence of a strong government. In 1990s after the dissipation of USSR control, waves of national hatred onslaught with civil wars and conflicts in many republics of the former “union”. These hatred attitudes against ‘other’ nations are still present and give voice wherever they can.</p>
<p>'Die you all.' is a common attitude; the feeling of bitter anger and intense fear runs deep in the country.</p>

<h3>Poverty</h3>
<p>Disgustingly loathsome indifference to the problem.</p>
<p>Gini coefficient rose from 0.23 (1988) to 0.5 (1992). Gini coefficient of 0.5 means that the probability that your neighbour is twice richer than you is 50%.</p> 
<p>Economy is filled with regulations and statists, with a high concentration of wealth in officials' hands. Energy and defence-related sectors are still unprivatized. Although money generally comes into Russian economy with the export of oil, natural gas, steel, aluminium and extensive machinery building,</p>
<p>Who buys Russian?</p>

<p>Mean GDP growth rate: from 1996, the year when the denomination of the currency occurred, mean yearly GDP growth rate is 1%.
<br>per capita GDP = 5,800$ in 1990,
<br>per capita GDP = 3,500$ in 1996,
<br>per capita GDP = 6,800$ in 2015,
<br>social security benefits = 1,200$ per year!!! in 1996,
<br>social security benefits = 200$ per month!!! in 2018.

<br>The Russian currency now is 0.07 of its 1996 value. I.e. rubble now is 14 times less needed than in 1996.
For the last 1.5 years rubble lost 50% of its value to compensate for the 50% drop in the oil prices. So in rubbles government still has the same revenues. To get the money quickly in times of crisis government de-values its currency. The central bank hasn’t supported the rouble since late 2014. It let the rouble float freely from Nov. 10 of that year and eliminated regular interventions after spending several dozen billions of dollars from its reserves.
Yet government officials continue to claim that ‘they won’t let rouble fall’. Send them to hell!!! They are vicious liars!
<br>Now with little access to world markets and low competitiveness Russian economic future is grim.</p>

<h3>Greenback, Vodka, and Power</h3>
<p>Russia drives people crazy.</p>
<p>Vice: in spite of USSR media and recreation control, also high level of propaganda, due to the growing disappointment about the results of the ‘communism’ and later the 'false democracy', the level of virtue in the country is low. The dissipation of USSR brought about the awakening of vice to the completely unprepared generation.</p>
<p>Love greenback and strong alcohol:</p>
 
<p>litres of pure alcohol consumption per capita 15l</p>
<p>cigarettes consumption per smoker 8,900 </p>
<p>52% of men and 12% of women smoke</p>
<p>est. 2.5mln drug addicts + regular drug users</p>
<p>registered living HIV-infected people 740,000</p>

<h3>"Defamate the President After His Retire", text by Ooou</h3>
<p>Vodka for last greenback,</p>
<p>Stupid yellow fans,</p>
<p>Always have nothing,</p>
<p>And have nothing to dig.</p>
<p>Stupid getting high,</p>
<p>Animals indeed.</p>
<p>Ki-i-i-ll the -cow!</p>
<p>Ea-a-at the -burgs!</p>
<p>Bwa ha ha ha ha!!!</p>
<p>Chorus</p>
<p>Defamate the Prez-Bandit,</p>
<p>Never let him see the grave.</p>
<p>Send him to the land of horror,</p>
<p>Live forever on the Russian Earth.</p>

<h3>Ural</h3>
<p>Have you ever heard about Mayak factory and the radioactive dust?</p>
<p>Mayak was the place where the government was developing atomic industry. Check, maybe you are flying over it? Please don't.</p>
<p>The only people who worked there where prisoners, who dumped the radioactive remains into the nearby dry lake.</p>

<h3>Bandits' Country Must Be Destroyed</h3>
<p>Russians are crazy. And escpecially when they are drunk with power.</p>
<p>Russia is an animal den with a huge wall around it, and the Russian Government Bandits mass homestead animals within the country-(side).</p>
<p>Will Evil listen if you tell it to stop?</p>
<p>Russia must be destroyed. Like the Pompeii was.</p>
<p>God have us throw up on Moscow.</p>
<p>How many nuclear H-bombs would it take to reduce Russia and the former USSR to pebbles?</p>
