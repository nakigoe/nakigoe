    <h3>Practice!</h3>
        <p>Use metal sticks first. You'll probably very soon find out that You want different weight and length for different types of training:
        form training, strength training, and speed training. You'll also find out that the right weight depends on your current condition. Sometimes you need recovery period and want to train with lighter weapons. Sometimes you would like a heavy sword. And when I say 'heavy', I mean 'HEAVY!'</p> 
        
        <p>You'll find out that You want different types of blades for different moves! Long and light for stabbing, mid-length and slightly curvy for cutting moves, shorter for slashing moves, and really short for dagger techniques.
		You'll find out you want a short, really curvy, heavy blade for the reverse grip.</p>

		<p>You'll also find out that you want completely different blades for single-handed vs two-handed techniques. Two-handed blades are usually longer and heavier and are used for slashing and cutting moves. The grip for two-handed swords is usually 1/4 length of a blade.</p>
		
		<p>Do you plan to cut through heavy armor? Then train maces and axes.</p>
		
		<p>Ask a local smith to make some custom iron sticks / blunt blades for training.</p>
		
		<p>Always train with iron sticks or blunt blades. Wear finger-open type gloves to protect your skin when training with pair swords.</p>
        
        <p>Never ever train with a real blade. Reasons being: you want to keep your custom blade razor sharp and polished. You want to keep the walls and furniture safe. You want to keep the people around you safe. And most importantly, you want to keep your body safe during training.</p>

        <p>Visit a good gym with lots of swords and grab one by one, performing your usual sword workout. Connect your body to the free continuous flow of action.</p>
        
        <p>Experiment with different swords as your skill, strength and agility improve.</p>
        
        <p>"This one and that one have good responsiveness, smooth and free flow of action. Feels right? Yeah, this one feels good, somewhat like that is perfect!"</p>
        
        <p>Take a video of the performance and check it. You'll see if the blade is too long, or light. If the blade is too light You'll feel the lack of power and momentum in movements. Controlling longer blade is harder when performing slashing movements, especially for a single-handed blade. When the blade is too long or the point of balance is too far away from Your hand, You'll definetely notice unacceptable time lags when changing direction and blade overswing when you try to stop movement.</p>

    <h3 property="name">Tech Info</h3>
    <div class="answer" property="text">
        <p>Point of Balance is closer to the grip for thrusting, further away for slashing; for smash &amp; slash you want a Point of Non-Vibration around the position of the index, middle, and ring fingers. The length of a single handed blade would be just short of the tip touching the ground when the weapon is held in the hand with the arm relaxed and hanging at your side. It does prevent the tip being scratched or blunted if you do swings from below. More important if the weapon is a work of art.</p>
        <p>Your weapon is both your attack and your defence, keep it in front of you. Length of your primary blade gives you the freedom to perform radical manoeuvres to attack from an unseen or unexpected direction.</p>
		<p>for single-handed blade the total length is usually 65 - 80cm; 77cm (30") sword is good if your height is 180cm (5'11").</p>
		<p>for two-handed blade the total length is usually 100 - 140cm; obviously not for home use, unless you own a stone castle.</p>

    <h3>American Style</h3>
    <div class="answer">
    <p>Uhh... are you being realistic here?</p>
    <p><em>A custom blade?</em> If it's for historical re-enactments that's one thing... But a true personal blade will cost you in the realm of $8000 and up. Who is going to make your sword?</p>
    <p>And you probably shouldn't use a sword for self-defence. That's just not being practical at all. Even folks I know who study swords don't walk around with a wakizashi in their coat. </p>
    <p>Knives are, arguably, a different matter. But I still think it's not the best choice for personal defence. Have you ever seen a knife fight? You don't want to see the result.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="question"><p>This would be for home defence.</p></div>
    
    <div class="answer"><p>I've worked in various hospitals on both coasts of the US. Last month I treated two patients in our Emergency Department who came in with their throats cut with improvised blades. An effective strike from a sword is more likely to maim and mutilate than kill. After years of treating thoracic punctures, abdominal stab injuries, deep lacerations to arms, legs and face, as well as a variety of gunshot wounds, I believe it's both more "humane" and more effective to use a firearm for self-defence.</p></div>
    
    <div class="answer"><p>My suggestion would be to get a partner or companion to a katana, the wakizashi. Indoors, the wakizashi is obviously more effective than a katana. It is light, one or two handed, strong, and can be primary or off hand in combat. I imagine that wielding two could be effective under many scenarios. They are also more easily concealed.</p></div> 
    
    <div class="answer"><p>Ok, just my thought on the <em>custom made sword for home defence...</em> Have a shotgun built into the thing. If someone breaks into your house they will most likely have a gun and if you pull a sword on them they will just have an excuse to shoot you.</p></div>
     
    <div class="answer"><p>Unless you're a Jedi, you will be wasting your money on a sword for home defence. I've trained for years in swordplay, and I know that there are only a handful of scenarios that home defence of a sword is the best option... And all of those options include an unarmed intruder. Because you won't know an intruder is armed until it's too late, the sword defence scenarios are out the window. Security doors and windows are a much better investment.</p></div>
    
    <div class="question"><p>I'm sorry, I've seem to have given the impression, somehow, that I am lurking about my house at night like some crazed vigilante Jedi wanna-be. This is not the case.</p>
    <p>I like swords.</p>
    <p>I like to know how to use swords.</p>
    <p>I was wondering if there is an ideal geometry for a particular type of blade compared to an individual.</p>
    <p>I have the means to get a custom sword, and want to get the best value for my money as well as the most efficient tool.</p>
    <p>That's pretty much it.</p> 
    <p>There is a non-zero chance that I will have an intruder and that kitchen knife, baseball bat, other sword, spear, chemical reagents, teddy bear, dictionary, flintlock rifle, cash, iron, fry pan, scimitar or any other potential implement of harm that I own will be farther away than this, currently potential, custom sword.</p>
    <p>I do, however, appreciate y'all's concern that I am about to do something foolish. Thank you. I am not.</p>
    <p>Thank you to those who replied.</p></div>
    
    <div class="answer"><p>Personally I like the feel and comfort of a Katana, but to be honest, I don't even know the length of the one I used to own. I just knew it was comfortable in my hands.</p></div>
    
    <div class="answer"><p>I have both a handgun and a Surefire flashlight within reach. Never underestimate the effectiveness of a good flashlight in ruining an opponent's night-vision. Take a high-output 200 lumen flashlight (maglight maybe?). An ideal home-defence weapon would have the light mounted onto it.</p>
    <p>Run a suppressor on your gun to protect your ears.</p>
    <p>Oh, and also try not to modify your defence weapon too much - outside of basic reliability. It might be a little tougher to be seen as a victim if you blasted a home invader to molecules with your .50 Browning M2HB Machine Gun.</p></div>
    
    <div class="answer">
      <p>For me myself, I'd want something that I could swing with the right arm, and left me enough balance for a heavy metal pipe in the left. An arm's length would be a good guess?</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="answer"><p>For the love of God! Man, if you're concerned about home security get a gun and forget the highlander scenarios. In lieu of a gun, get a dog. In lieu of a dog just strategically place explosives all over your domicile, it’s almost as practical as going after an intruder with a sword. If I were you I'd find a sporting goods store and buy yourself a baseball bat. Get an aluminium one if you want to be fancy about it. With the aluminium as a plus you can always hook a car battery (plus sign) up to it and duel with your buddy (hook minus sign) and get the cool sparking effect!</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="answer"><p>Buy the bat/wakizashi, and fix two 200 lumen flashlights to it (use insulating tape). You’ll be cooler than a Jedi!</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="answer"><p>And you can use your MacBook with a ballistic shield! Make hooks in a ballistic shield to fix your Mac, and you can turn the video record on! Buy Mac-compatible ballistic shield!!!</p></div>
    
    <div class="answer"><p>Buy a helmet too! Choose one with Google Glass and one-eye-night-vision-optics attached to it!!! You can go online live!</p></div>
